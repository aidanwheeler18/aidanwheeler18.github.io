My Blackbeard and Henry Morgan mapping project is coming along well. Since my last blog post, I have narrowed down many key points about the project which I will clarify with this post. The main two parts of the project I have made major decisions on is the main map which the project will cover as well as the mapping software I will use to visualize and offer user interaction. 
Firstly, the mapping software I have chosen to use is Axis Maps. After thorough research and investigating the final products of similar mapping projects I have landed on Axis Maps. In part, the reason for this decision is that this is the exact mapping software used by the project “Slave Revolt in Jamaica”. This is a project I have found useful in so many ways. One of the many reasons for this is the similar time period, location, and the fact that it is also a mapping project. 
I do believe it is beneficial to have a project to mirror in many ways like this one. It helps steer me in the right direction and to avoid making decisions that may not lead to the most positive outcome. In this situation, it is better to learn from other people’s mistakes than to make those same mistakes which may cost valuable time and money.
The next big decision I had to pin down was the specific map which would be the base for my whole project. After much deliberation, I landed on a map that covered all the necessities I’d need for my project. The map I chose was “No. 6. North America corrected from the latest discoveries and observations”. This map was made by George Willdey in 1717. The fact that this map was published just a year prior to the death of Blackbeard seemed to be almost fate. 
That alone wasn’t the only reason for choosing this map. At first, I was attempting to find something from an earlier date as Henry Morgan was active in the 1670s and 80s. I found that following this period there was a significant improvement in the qualities of maps. Although it may have been nice to have a map from a period correlating to a time period in-between the active periods of both men, the best decision was to choose a more aesthetic map still true to the time period. 
This map is meticulous and detailed with specific on map labels of important locations such as Delaware Bay, Cayman Islands, Port Royal, and more. There were many artistic liberties taken on the map including many ships sailing on open waters. I will be able to either use these to my advantage by incorporating them into the map as people click from location to location the ships would travel along the route that Blackbeard and Henry Morgan did. If this is more difficult than I imagine I will be able to use Photoshop to remove them to allow the user to focus on the relevant information of the map.
