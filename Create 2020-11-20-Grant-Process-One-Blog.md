title: Grant Process One Post
---

My project is a mapping project on two of the most infamous pirates from the Caribbean Golden Age of Piracy: Blackbeard and Henry Morgan. The mapping project will also include a map and timeline and will be able to help the user visualize the lives of these famous figures. The map and timeline will be able to show the pathing of Blackbeard and Henry Morgan separately or at the same time. This will help the user contrast the similarities and differences between the two men. The program will add detailed records at each stop in the adventure of the pirates making it a great learning tool for the individuals using it.
Throughout my research, I did find another project like what I am attempting to make. This project called “The Real Pirates of the Caribbean”, is also a mapping project but lacks the main tenants that my project would be able to add to. This would lead to a much better product. One of the important parts lacking is a timeline to the map. Also, the map by “The Real Pirates of the Caribbean” lacks in interactivity and detail. The map only lists six locations for Blackbeard for example which undersells the full extent of his travel. I currently plan on listing a total of 34 travel locations for Blackbeard. Also, I plan on having various viewing options for the map. This will allow the user to view a current day map and also maps from the eras in which the pirates were active.
My progress on the grant project has been a mixed bag lately. I have had fun learning new things about notorious figures from an infamous time in history but feel the period I have selected has made research more difficult than I had imagined. Due to the setting of the early 18th century and the fact that the project is on pirates who never kept any formal records I have had to dig deeper than I had pictured. Although I haven’t been able to find many first had records from the Pirates themselves that I am conducting research on, I have found success finding witness accounts and records from the British Empire and the various settlements in the Caribbean.
I do still imagine my project as when I did when I first imagined it. I have had bumps along the way with the research process. As I have progressed it has helped me realize the necessity for this type of project to be completed. The lack of centralized information on the travels of pirates in the Caribbean is a major shortcoming. It prohibits the understanding of the extent of travel by individual pirates. My project will explain the pervasiveness of not only their travels but also their destruction.
My plan for the future is to continue my research, finding more and more records of locations these pirates visited during their days of piracy. I also plan to continue to improve on the visuals that I have thus far made to help further explain what exactly my final product will look like. I plan on basing my visuals on the project “Jamaican Slave Revolt”, which will be using the same mapping software my project will.
