The project that I worked on coding was a one-page transcription of “The Yellow Wallpaper”, by Charlotte Perkins Stetson. The project included many parts. This included a Google Doc exercise where I highlighted the specific parts of the page that needed special code to display on the final product. The next part included taking that page and using the program Oxygen to complete the coding process. The project was especially interesting as I had to code the first page of the narrative. This required special text for things like the illustration, title, and byline. 
                                                                                                                                                                 
That first part of the project was definitely made interesting by having the first page of the narrative. I had to highlight all the parts of the page that would need specialty coding. I had to highlight things like italics, em dashes, the title, the byline, the illustration, and the illustration description. The process was labor-intensive, but it paid off during the coding process where I had a point of reference to all the things I would need to code.

The next part of the project involved a deep dive into the coding process using the Oxygen program. It became clear moments into using this program that it would be much easier to use than I had thought. The two major reasons this was so was the error identification software and the autofill code generation. 
                                                                                                                                                                 
The error identification software made it easy to locate where in the code there were errors so I could go back and fix them. It underlined my code errors with a squiggly red line much like Microsoft Word would or any other writing software. The autofill for the code was useful in how it suggested new lines of code as they were being written. This made the writing process smoother as I could click the suggested code allowing me to cut down on time typing. It was especially useful if I had forgotten what line of code needed to go next as it would often suggest the right line.
                                                                                                                                                                 
The only parts of the coding process I became frustrated with was when error in code came up that I couldn’t figure out how to fix. This feeling of being stuck was one of the main points of frustration in coding as a whole. When you don’t know where to go or what’s wrong it will feel right to sit and do nothing. I learned that if you tweak the code around the area where the error is or moving the dysfunctional line as a whole it will more often than not fix itself.

One of the main errors I had to deal with in my code was that the end of lines of codes often needed a backslash in between the angled brackets. The one other main problem I ran into was that my page had two instances where an italicized word was directly next to an em dash. This became an issue as both required a specialty string of code. It became confusing to figure out where the error was coming from and how to space out the code.

All in all, the coding process was one that I found to be much less of a headache than I thought it might have been. It was nice to learn to plan out the coding process in Google Docs before moving to Oxygen. Although the page that I transcribed required more specialized code, I am glad I had the opportunity to learn the extra code. It added variety to the project and was a fun experience.
