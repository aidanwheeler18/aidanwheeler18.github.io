The project, Digital Harlem Everyday Life 1915-1930, explores life during the Harlem Renaissance. The Project focuses on events including Parties, Arrests, Sporting Events, Funerals, and Fires. The site maps out each event on a map of New York also showing the area Harlem covered at different times in history. The site allows you to visually explore both types of events, individuals, and places. With the map, the site also uses a timeline to allow you to visualize the data in two different ways. Digital Harlem Everyday Life 1915-1930 shows what everyday people experienced during the Harlem Renaissance.

One thing this project does great is the multitude of different options it gives the user. Harlem Digital uses the web application “Heurist”. It is an academic knowledge management system developed by Dr. Ian Johnson. This includes seeing the data at different times in Harlem’s history from 1915-1930. This helps the user learn not only how Harlem was during the period, but also how it changed. The way the map outlines where Harlem was during different decades in history exemplifies this.

This project is an interactive tool for everyday people, but the site is also used for scholarly work. Digital Harlem won the Roy Rosenzweig Prize for Innovation in Digital History and the ABC-CLIO Online History Award. A Discovery Grant from the Australian Research Council and a Sesqui Research and Development Grant from the University of Sydney supported the project. Four historians in the Department of History at the University of Sydney started the project. It was later supported and continued by other professors. Harlem Digital compiled evidence from legal records and newspapers between 1915 and 1930.

Critiques I have about this DH Project would be its User Interface. The project shines with an interactive map and timeline, but they only take up the middle third of the main page. A significant part of the page is taken up by the header, search section, legend, and maps sections. There is an importance to these features, but many other DH Projects find a way to do more efficient.

A unique feature about this DH Project is its ability to choose and follow the life of individuals. It’s a great feature that sums up the life of individuals and tracks their path through Harlem on the map and timeline. These stories were great and definitely a highlight, but it was disappointing as the project only offered six of these stories. It is understandable because making these requires a large amount of information on one individual, but it would have been nice to see a few more.

While Digital Harlem focuses on data points and single events it manages to incorporate a more text heavy aspect within the stories of individuals. While you are tracking individuals on the map and the timeline there is a convenient part of the page dedicated to a written summary of that individual’s life. This helps the project as it gives context to the map and timeline and allows you understand the life of the person you are following through Harlem.
